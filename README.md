# Websites Design Spot

In this [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project, I built a full-stack website based around web development services business, where the work of the company is displayed to potential customers and public in general.
I setup an authentication system and a contact page, so users and company's staff are able to interact with each other to suit their goals.
 
## UX
 
The design thinking approach of this site started writing the user stories to learn about the needs of the future users, as well as the requirements and needs of
the owner of the site, in this case a web development company. Next to this, I created the wireframes, that depict the layouts for the main pages and their responsive views, to have an idea about how to allocate the content and the possible behaviours of the functionalities that will be available.

The site allows users to explore different designs and communicate their goals with the company via contact page, to order a specific web design and pay for the development of it. The compamny is able to logging as admin in the backend of the site and manage the orders and users through an administrator panel and create, update and delete the web designs and details that will be showcased along the site.

- **User stories** and **wireframes** created and followed for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/pazcm/websites-design-spot/tree/master/static/mockups).

- On other hand, I used [Trello](https://trello.com/en) to plan the project spliting the work in tasks and tracking the work done as well as taking notes during the development. See a pic of my trello board [here](https://github.com/pazcm/websites-design-spot/tree/master/static/planning).

    - The project uses an Visual Studio IDE for development.

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
    - The project uses Django, a high-level [Python](https://www.python.org/) BE framework to create the app alongs with the Python templates' engine [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) for the structure.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses Bootstrap as a responsive FE framework taking advantage of some default stylings and components.

- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
    - The project uses CSS3 to create custom style.

    - The project uses Stripe platform to accept payments from the website.

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home)
    - The project uses the hosting platform Heroku to deploy and run the app.


## Testing

During the development I drove constantly manual testing for checking work functionalities and behaviours as well as I continuosly used several devices emulators with different screen sizes for Responsive testing; such as Nexus 5X, Nexus 10, Galaxy S5, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad and iPad Pro,...
In addition, I crossbrowser testing the site in Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers using their respective developer tools.

[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) .- I used this service which is connected to my GitHub account and automatically builds and tests small code changes.

- - HTML was validated using the Markup Validation Service provided by The World Wide Web Consortium: https://validator.w3.org/

- - CSS was validated using the CSS Validation Service provided by The World Wide Web Consortium: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

*Note:* The W3C CSS Validation Service doesn't recognize root variables yet, and therefore parses several errors due to
the global CSS variables I have set:

`5	:root	Parse Error --color-white: #fff;`

`6	:root	Parse Error --color-black: #000;`

`7	:root	Parse Error --color-white-bsw: #f1f1f1;`

`8	:root	Parse Error --color-light-grey: #ebebeb;`

`...`


## Deployment

To **Setup my virtual local environment** in a Mac, I installed [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) v1.11.17 and created a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pazcm/websites-design-spot). The steps that I went after were the following:

1. `brew update`

2. `xcode-select --install`

3. `brew install python3`

4. install Pip package management system -> `sudo easy_install pip`

5. install virtualenv for python -> `sudo pip install virtualenv`

6. create a project folder -> `mkdir websites-design-spot`

7. then inside the project folder, create the virtual env -> `python3.7 -m venv vE0`

8. activate it to install the required project packages -> `source vE0/bin/activate` ~ shorthand `. vE0/bin/activate` || to exit (vE0) use : `deactivate`

9. use pip to install the package django ('vE0'activate):
  - `sudo pip install django==1.11.17`
  - `pip list`

10. in root directory add requirements file -> `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

11. `django-admin startproject <website_design_spot>`

12. inside the repo to run the dev server -> `python3.7 manage.py runserver`

13. `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`


Then:

1. I created a [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) account and **.travis.yml** file at the top level of the project (with language, version, install and a dummy secret key) for Continuous Integration so it will run tests on my code every time it is pushed to GitHub.

2. I added **Procfile** for Heroku to call the app => `webgunicorn websites_design_spot.wsgi:application` at the same level that manage.py.

3. I run the app in the local environment to make sure everything is in order with the Procfile and the Requirements file before try to deploy.

4. In **settings.py** file, I updated the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable from an empty list to `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['127.0.0.1', 'websites-design-spot.herokuapp.com']`.

5. I Pushed the changes from [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to [Git/GitHub](https://github.com).

6. I login to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) platform and **'Create a new app'** via the dashboard. It provided a cloud Postgres database.

7. In Heroku dashboard settings, I configured the variables for AWS, DataBase and Stripe.

8. I **'Deploy Branch'** and **'Open app'** from Heroku dashboard => [Website]
